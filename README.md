# HMM-FRET
Custom MATLAB code for Hidden Markov Analysis of single molecule FRET data.
The program intensity_FRET_HMM is the main execution code. The functions kmean, HMM and statetransitions are custom functions serve the main program intensity_FRET_HMM.  The data format needs to be in txt format containing three columns of data, frames, donor intensity and acceptor intensity.
